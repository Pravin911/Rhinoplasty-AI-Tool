# Rhinoplasty-AI-Tool
Project Description: AI-Based Rhinoplasty Visualization Tool
The AI-Based Rhinoplasty Visualization Tool is a cutting-edge web application designed to help individuals visualize potential outcomes of rhinoplasty (nose reshaping) surgeries. By leveraging advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies, this tool allows users to upload their side and front-profile images and receive realistic visualizations of different nose shapes and styles. Whether considering subtle adjustments or more significant changes, users can explore how various reshaping styles will affect the appearance of their nose, enabling them to make more informed decisions before pursuing surgery.

The tool utilizes MediaPipe, a powerful framework for facial landmark detection, to identify key features of the face, particularly the nose. It provides users with a range of customizable styles such as natural, refined, and upturned noses, with additional options for advanced tuning. These options allow fine-tuning of the nose bridge width, tip projection, alar width, and more. Users can also adjust the angle of the nose tip, visualize potential dorsal hump alterations, and view the 3D model of their reshaped nose with dynamic lighting effects for a more realistic experience.

The backend of the application is built using Flask and Python, providing easy API endpoints for image uploads, face analysis, and nose reshaping. The tool's frontend is designed for user-friendly interactions, making it accessible to a wide audience. It is intended to be used not only for personal use but also in medical settings, where professionals can recommend potential changes based on the visualizations generated.

With this tool, patients can better understand how rhinoplasty procedures might look on their face, helping them make confident choices and enabling surgeons to tailor the procedure to the patientâ€™s unique facial features.
